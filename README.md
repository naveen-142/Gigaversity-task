# Gender Bias in Hiring – Data Analytics Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates potential gender bias in job placement outcomes using real-world educational data. The analysis was conducted as part of a Data Analytics Internship Challenge from Gigaversity.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To identify whether gender plays a significant role in job placement and understand how academic performance and work experience influence placement outcomes.


## 📁 Project Structure
- `Placement_GenderBias_Analysis.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with full pipeline
- `Placement_Analysis_Report.pdf` – Summary report with key insights and recommendations
- `Placement_Data.csv` – Dataset used for the analysis


## 🔍 Analysis Flow
### 1. Problem Framing & Hypothesis
- **H1**: Gender and placement are independent (no bias).
- **H2**: Gender and placement are dependent (possible bias).


### 2. Descriptive Analysis
- Cleaned and prepared data
- Explored distribution of placements by gender, specialization, and experience
- Visualized trends using seaborn and matplotlib

### 3. Diagnostic Analysis
- Compared placement outcomes between male/female and experienced/non-experienced
- Performed Chi-Square Test to check for gender bias

### 4. Predictive Modeling
- Applied **Logistic Regression** to predict placement
- Achieved **88% accuracy**
- Important predictors: MBA %, test score, work experience

### 5. Prescriptive Insights
- No statistical evidence of gender bias
- Work experience and academic strength increase placement odds
- Recommendations for training support, experience programs, and policy reviews


## 📈 Key Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
- Statistical testing (Chi-Square, Logistic Regression)


## 📌 Outcome
This project demonstrates the ability to:
- Frame hypotheses from real-world challenges
- Apply descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive techniques
- Communicate insights through visuals and reporting
